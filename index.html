            Backend development (also stylized as back-end or back end development) is the skill that powers the web. Yet it does it modestly, without fanfare‚Äîallowing people to browse their favorite sites without even knowing about all the work put in by the backend developer or team. <br />

            So to help dispel this mystery‚Ä¶ what is backend development? How do backend technologies work? What are some back end developer languages? <br />

            Backend development languages handle the ‚Äòbehind-the-scenes‚Äô functionality of web applications. It‚Äôs code that connects the web to a database, manages user connections, and powers the web application itself. Backend development works in tandem with the front end to deliver the final product to the end user. <br />

            <p class="topic">What Is Back End Development?</p> <br />
            

            What is backend programming/development? As mentioned above, backend development is what keeps the internet running behind the scenes. <br />

            Backend developers are primarily focused on how a website works. They write code that focuses on the functionality and logic powering the application they‚Äôre working on, and the technology they work on is never directly seen by users.<br />

            Backend technologies are a combination of servers, applications, and databases. <br />

            Responsibilities of backend programmers could involve writing APIs, writing code to interact with a database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and much more. The exact duties of a back end web developer often depend on the specific role and company. <br />
        </div>
        <div id="section-3">
            <p class="topic">Frontend Vs Backend Programming</p><br />
            

            Intuitively, the other side of backend development is the front end. <br />

            The key difference is that while backend developers build how a website functions, front-end programmers build and design the interface, determining how the site looks to users. <br />

            Backend web development lays the foundational code that enables websites to process the actions that users take on the front end and deliver the correct information in return.<br />

            Neither works without the other‚Äîyou need the back end to make the front end work, and you need the front end so people can actually access and interact with the website. <br />

            üí∞ Backend developers typically earn higher salaries than front-end developers, as back end languages tend to be more technical. The average salary for a backend developer is $114,608, while front-end developers earn $100,966. <br />

            There are also full-stack developers, who can work with both front-end and backend technologies. They‚Äôre the jack-of-all-trades of the programming world. <br />
        </div>
        <div id="section-4">
            <p class="topic">What Does a Backend Developer Do?</p><br />
            

            So what does a backend developer actually do in a typical workday? <br />

            ‚ÄúReflecting on a typical working day, I‚Äôd say I spend 50% of my time on project work, 20% in meetings and on general communication, and the remaining 30% working on immediate requests and bugs.‚Äù<br />

            So, as a back end web developer, you might spend your day doing things like: <br />

            ‚Ä¢ Maintaining legacy applications (older applications that have already been built by other programmers)<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Putting out fires (e.g., bugs, broken applications)<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Attending meetings (to gather requirements for a project<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Collaborate with front end devs on a project, etc.)<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Actually writing code for new applications/projects<br />

            So, while you will certainly be coding with back end languages, don‚Äôt picture that as being the only thing you‚Äôll do as a back end web developer.<br />

            <p class="topic">Types of Backend Development Languages</p><br />
            

            Backend programming can either be object-oriented (OOP) or functional.<br />

            OOP is the technique that focuses on the creation of objects. With object-oriented programming, statements should be executed in a particular order. Popular OOP languages are Java, .NET, and Python,<br />

            Functional back end programming is a technique that is more ‚Äúaction‚Äù-based. Functional programming uses declarative language, which means that statements can be executed in any order. It‚Äôs commonly used for data science, and popular languages are SQL, F#, and R.<br />

            Back end languages can either be statically typed or dynamically typed. The former is more rigid, but better at catching errors, whereas the latter is more flexible but allows for variables to change types (which could account for unexpected errors).<br />
        </div>
        <div id="python">
            <p class="topic">Backend Language: Python</p><br />
            

            There‚Äôs a reason Python is the fastest-growing programming language. The versatile backend language is used for both web and desktop development. Like with Java, there are plenty of tutorials and guides online, making it one of the more accessible back end languages for those just starting out.<br />

            Furthermore, its syntax is simple and easy to understand compared to other backend developer languages. Those who program with Python have lauded it for its ‚Äúelegant,‚Äù ‚Äúreadable,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù code on Stack Overflow.<br /><br />

            üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH PYTHON<br />

            Some of the most popular uses for Python include:

            ‚Ä¢ Cross-platform shell scripting <br />

            ‚Ä¢ Quick automation <br />

            ‚Ä¢ Simple web development <br /><br />

            üíº COMPANIES THAT USE PYTHON <br />

            Among the biggest companies using Python as a programming language are:<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Uber<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Pinterest<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Mozilla<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Spotify<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Quora<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Pandora<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Netflix<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Asana<br /><br />

            üíµ AVERAGE SALARY OF PYTHON DEVELOPERS<br />

        <div id="sql">
            <p class="topic">Backend Language: SQL</p><br />
            

            Structured Query Language or SQL (pronounced ‚Äòsequel‚Äô) is the most common query language. SQL is used to interact with databases.<br />

            SQL is great for beginners to learn since it‚Äôs a declarative language. A declarative language allows coders to ‚Äòdeclare‚Äô the results they would like to see, without specifying the steps or process for said result.<br />

            A query language like SQL is great for those who want to take advantage of the wealth of knowledge stored in databases.<br /><br />

            üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH SQL<br />

            SQL is used to access, manipulate, and create databases.<br />

            Those who work closely with data can benefit from learning SQL. This includes financial analysts, data-driven marketers, or online entrepreneurs. SQL is an ideal stepping stone for those who want to dive into the world of Big Data. For some inspiration, here is a list of jobs that use SQL the most.<br /><br />

            üíº COMPANIES THAT USE SQL<br />

            Since SQL is a query language, its use is broad and widespread. If a company or enterprise has a database, it is extremely probable that they are using SQL to query it.<br /><br />

            üíµ AVERAGE SALARY OF SQL DEVELOPERS<br />

            As of November 2021, SQL developers made an average of $87,799/year in the US.<br />

        <div id="jscript">
            <p class="topic">Backend Language: JavaScript</p><br />
            

            Not to be confused with Java, JavaScript is a language that can be used for both the front end and back end.<br />

            It‚Äôs a great language for beginners because it is a higher-level language and there is little setup involved (you can start coding in your browser).<br />

            Because the language is so flexible, objects created in this language are slow. It is also difficult to maintain and scale, as with most dynamically typed languages.<br />

            Having said that, the language is ubiquitous, which means the community is large‚Äîaffording you a slew of resources and plenty of opportunities for employment if you know JavaScript backend technologies, such as Node.js.<br /><br />

            üí° WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH JAVASCRIPT<br />

            JavaScript can be used to build many types of sites and software, including:<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Websites<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Mobile apps <br />

            ‚Ä¢ Desktop applications<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Games<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Web servers<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Presentations<br />

            ‚Ä¢ And more<br /><br />

            üíº COMPANIES THAT USE JAVASCRIPT<br />

            Famous companies using JavaScript include:<br />

            ‚Ä¢ Airbnb<br />

            <p class="topic">Other Backend Skills To Know</p><br />
            

            As you start to learn backend development, here are some other backend skills you may need that are not programming languages.<br />

            Backend Skill #1: Databases / and Cache<br />

            As a backend developer, it can be helpful to understand how databases and database caching works. Caching is a technique that stores frequently-queried data in a temporary memory. It supplements a primary database by removing unnecessary pressure on it. <br />

            Many backend job descriptions require knowledge of Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, SQL Server, and caching mechanisms like Redis and Memcached. <br />

            Backend Skill #2: Web servers<br />

            A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests. As a backend developer, you may need to know production web server technologies such as load balancers (e.g., Nginx and HTTP proxies).<br />

            Backend Skill #3: API (REST & SOAP)<br />

            APIs, Application programming interfaces, allow two separate applications to talk to each other. They play a role in how most server-side software architectures are built. <br />

            Two API styles you might come across as a backend developer are SOAP and REST.  SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. <br />

            <p class="topic">Start Taking Courses to Learn Backend Development!</p><br />
            

            In this overview, I hope you were able to get a clearer picture of backend development and the capabilities of each language included. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the backend languages that are out there. If you‚Äôre interested in learning more,  Youtube, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, have easy-to-understand resources to guide you further.<br />

            If you are considering pursuing a career as a back end web developer, I would highly recommend taking a look at the job descriptions of the roles you‚Äôre interested in and make a note of the backend languages that appear the most. Then, learn backend development languages and skills using courses like the ones highlighted above.<br />

            Don‚Äôt let the industry jargon scare you. Remember that an expert at anything was once a beginner too.<br />
